# House_Price_Predication - Flask Web App

### About the Project:
I build and train a regression model, and then deploy it so users can interact with it through a web interface. I trained the model using a Jupyter notebook and saved it as a .pkl file using pickle. Then I built a Flask app that takes inputs from a form, sends them to the model, and shows the predicted price on page.

### Files Included:
Train_Model.ipynb – training and saving the model \n
app.py – Flask code that loads the model and handles the prediction logic \n
templates/index.html – frontend form \n
house_price_model.pkl – trained regression model

### Requirements:
Sci-kit Learn \n
Pandas \n
Flask \n
Numpy
