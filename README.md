# House_Price_Predication - Flask Web App

### About the Project:
I build and train a regression model, and then deploy it so users can interact with it through a web interface. I trained the model using a Jupyter notebook and saved it as a .pkl file using pickle. Then I built a Flask app that takes inputs from a form, sends them to the model, and shows the predicted price on page.

### Files Included:
Train_Model.ipynb – training and saving the model
app.py – Flask code that loads the model and handles the prediction logic
templates/index.html – frontend form
house_price_model.pkl – trained regression model

### Requirements:
Sci-kit Learn
Pandas
Flask
Numpy
